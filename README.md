### Learning Reflections

This project represents my first significant foray into modern frontend development. Coming from a data science background, I wanted to challenge myself to learn new technologies and expand my skill set. Some key learning areas included:

- React component architecture and hooks
- TypeScript integration with React
- CSS variables and modern styling approaches
- Responsive design principles
- API integration with Google Gemini
- Deployment and CI/CD through Vercel

I believe that understanding both data science and web development creates a valuable intersection of skills, especially for creating interactive data applications and AI-powered experiences.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jbanmol/jbanmol.git
   cd jbanmol
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Google Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates optimized files in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment on Vercel:

- The repository is connected to Vercel for automatic deployments
- The `vercel.json` configuration handles build settings and routing
- Each commit to the main branch triggers a new deployment
